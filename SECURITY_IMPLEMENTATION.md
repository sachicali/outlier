### 6. Security Monitoring & Auditing
**Location**: `server/src/middleware/securityMonitoring.js`

- **Security Event Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-related events
- **Failed Login Tracking**: Account lockout after failed attempts
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Pattern-based threat detection
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit log for administrative actions
- **Real-time Alerting**: Automated alerts for security incidents

**Monitoring Capabilities**:
- Failed login attempt tracking with progressive lockout
- Unusual user agent detection
- Suspicious request pattern identification
- Real-time security event dashboards
- Automated threat response

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Database Security
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db

# JWT Security
JWT_SECRET=<64-character-random-string>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<64-character-random-string>

# API Security
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<youtube-api-key>
API_SIGNING_SECRET=<api-signing-secret>

# Session Security
SESSION_SECRET=<session-secret>

# CSRF Security
CSRF_STRICT_IP=true  # Enable strict IP checking

# Rate Limiting
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
API_RATE_WINDOW=900000  # 15 minutes
API_RATE_LIMIT=1000

# Security Headers
NODE_ENV=production  # Enables strict security mode
```

### Security Middleware Integration

The security system is integrated through `server/src/middleware/securityIntegration.js`:

1. **Core Security**: Applied first in middleware stack
2. **Authentication Security**: Applied to auth endpoints
3. **API Security**: Applied to API endpoints
4. **Admin Security**: Applied to admin endpoints

### Health Checks

- **Main Health Check**: `/health` - Overall system health
- **Security Health Check**: `/health/security` - Security system status (admin only)
- **Admin Security Dashboard**: `/api/admin/security/dashboard` - Comprehensive security metrics

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Redundant validation at different layers
- Graceful degradation when components fail

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key scopes limiting access
- Admin-only endpoints for sensitive operations

### 3. Security by Default
- Secure defaults for all configurations
- Automatic security header application
- Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting
