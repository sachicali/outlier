# YouTube Outlier Discovery Tool - Project Brief

## Project Vision

The YouTube Outlier Discovery Tool is an intelligent content discovery platform designed to help YouTube creators identify high-performing video opportunities from "adjacent" channels while avoiding oversaturated content from direct competitors.

## Core Purpose

**Primary Goal**: Discover trending video opportunities that align with a creator's brand by analyzing statistical outliers in similar but non-competing channels.

**The Intelligence**: Instead of copying direct competitors, the tool finds channels in the same niche (family-friendly gaming) that play different games, then identifies their breakout videos using statistical analysis.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **YouTube Content Creators** (10K-1M subscribers)
  - Family-friendly gaming channels
  - Looking for fresh content ideas
  - Want to stay ahead of trends without copying competitors

### Secondary Users
- **Content Strategists** and **Channel Managers**
- **Multi-Channel Networks (MCNs)**
- **Gaming Industry Analysts**

## Key Success Metrics

### Technical Performance
- **API Efficiency**: <10,000 YouTube API units per analysis
- **Processing Speed**: 2-5 minutes for complete channel analysis
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 70%+ for repeat analyses
- **Accuracy Rate**: 85%+ on outlier identification

### Business Value
- **Content Discovery Time**: Reduce from hours to minutes
- **Trend Identification**: 7-14 days ahead of competitors
- **Content Replicability**: 80%+ of discovered videos should be adaptable
- **Brand Safety**: 95%+ family-friendly content alignment

## Scope Definition

### Core Features (In Scope)
1. **Exclusion-First Discovery** - Build competitor exclusion lists
2. **Adjacent Channel Detection** - Find similar but non-competing channels
3. **Statistical Outlier Analysis** - Identify videos performing 2-5x above average
4. **Brand Compatibility Scoring** - Rate content alignment with user's brand
5. **Real-time Processing** - Live progress tracking with Socket.IO
6. **Export & Integration** - CSV export and API access

### Advanced Features (Future Scope)
- Machine learning for improved brand fit prediction
- Automated competitor monitoring
- Historical trend analysis
- Team collaboration features
- Mobile app development
- Advanced analytics dashboard

### Explicit Exclusions
- Direct video downloading or storage
- Content creation tools
- Channel management features
- Monetization tracking
- Copyright or legal compliance checking

## Technical Constraints

### Hard Constraints
- **YouTube Data API v3 Quota**: 10,000 units/day (default)
- **Response Time**: <30 seconds for analysis initiation
- **Data Retention**: No permanent video storage (privacy)
- **Subscriber Range**: 10K-500K (sweet spot for replicable content)

### Soft Constraints
- **Brand Focus**: Family-friendly gaming content (expandable)
- **Time Window**: 1-30 days analysis window
- **Result Limit**: 50 outliers per analysis (performance)
- **Concurrent Analyses**: 5 max (resource management)

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- [ ] Successful competitor exclusion list building
- [ ] Adjacent channel discovery with 20+ qualified channels
- [ ] Outlier detection with configurable thresholds
- [ ] Basic brand fit scoring (5+ factors)
- [ ] Real-time progress updates
- [ ] CSV export functionality

### Version 1.0 Goals
- [ ] Sub-3 minute analysis completion
- [ ] 85%+ user satisfaction with discovered content
- [ ] <5% false positive rate on outlier detection
- [ ] Successful deployment to production environment
- [ ] Basic user authentication and session management

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **YouTube API Changes**: Quota limits, endpoint modifications
- **Data Quality**: Inconsistent video metadata, hidden statistics
- **Brand Fit Accuracy**: Subjective nature of content compatibility

### Medium Risk
- **Scalability**: Redis/database performance under load
- **Cost Management**: API quota usage vs. user demand
- **Competition**: Similar tools entering the market

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement robust caching and API quota monitoring
- Build flexible brand fit algorithms with user feedback loops
- Design scalable architecture from the start
- Focus on unique value proposition (exclusion-first approach)

## Definition of Done

A successful implementation will:
1. Process a real creator's competitor list and return actionable video opportunities
2. Complete analysis within API quota limits consistently
3. Provide clear, exportable results with confidence scores
4. Demonstrate measurable time savings vs. manual research
5. Maintain 99% uptime during business hours
6. Pass security and privacy compliance requirements
