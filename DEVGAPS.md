# Development Gaps

This document outlines the identified development gaps in the YouTube Outlier Discovery Tool codebase.

## 1. Testing

**Gap:** The project has testing frameworks (`jest`, `supertest`) installed, but there are no actual tests implemented.

**Impact:** This makes it difficult to refactor the code with confidence and to ensure that new features don't break existing functionality.

**Recommendations:**

-   **Unit Tests:** Add unit tests for the services in the backend, especially for the `outlierDetectionService.js` and `youtubeService.js`.
-   **Integration Tests:** Add integration tests for the API endpoints to ensure they are working as expected.
-   **Frontend Tests:** Add tests for the React components to ensure they render correctly and that user interactions work as expected.

## 2. Data Persistence

**Gap:** The analysis results are currently stored in-memory in the `outlier.js` route file. This means that all analysis data is lost when the server restarts.

**Impact:** The application is not suitable for production use as it cannot store historical data.

**Recommendations:**

-   **Implement PostgreSQL Integration:** The `memory-bank` documents mention that PostgreSQL is planned. This should be implemented to store analysis results, user data, and other persistent information.
-   **Create a Database Schema:** Design and implement a database schema to store the data in a structured way.

## 3. Security

**Gap:** The application lacks user authentication and authorization.

**Impact:** Anyone can access the API and start an analysis, which is a major security risk. It also makes it impossible to implement user-specific features.

**Recommendations:**

-   **Implement User Authentication:** Add a user authentication system, such as JWT-based authentication, to secure the API.
-   **Implement User Authorization:** Add role-based access control to restrict access to certain features.

## 4. Error Handling

**Gap:** The error handling is basic. While there is a centralized error handler, it could be more robust.

**Impact:** Errors might not be handled gracefully, leading to a poor user experience.

**Recommendations:**

-   **More Specific Error Handling:** Add more specific error handling for different types of errors (e.g., database errors, API errors).
-   **User-Friendly Error Messages:** Provide more user-friendly error messages on the client-side to help users understand what went wrong.

## 5. Hardcoded Values

**Gap:** There are hardcoded values in the code, such as the search queries in `server/src/services/outlierDetectionService.js`.

**Impact:** This makes the application less flexible and harder to configure.

**Recommendations:**

-   **Move to Configuration:** Move hardcoded values to the `.env` file or a separate configuration file to make them easily configurable.

## 6. Frontend Improvements

**Gap:** The frontend is functional but could be improved in several areas.

**Impact:** A better user experience could lead to higher user satisfaction and engagement.

**Recommendations:**

-   **Loading and Empty States:** Improve the loading and empty states to provide better feedback to the user.
-   **Filtering and Sorting:** Add filtering and sorting options to the results table to make it easier for users to find the information they are looking for.
-   **Responsiveness:** Improve the responsiveness of the application to ensure it works well on different screen sizes.
